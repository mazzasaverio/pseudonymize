# Policies

`Policy.default()` enables structured identifiers, secrets, URL credentials, and person,
organization, and location entities when a configured backend can detect them.
`Policy.strict()` enables the same entities with a lower confidence threshold. `Policy.llm()`
enables all available entities. `Policy.financial()` limits detection to IBANs and payment
cards.

Paths are dot-separated segments. `*` matches one segment, so `messages.*.content` matches list
indices. Exclusions win over inclusions. Dictionary keys are not transformed.

## Network policy

`NetworkPolicy.DENY` is the default and prevents every remote-capable backend invocation.
`ALLOW_CONFIGURED` permits only names copied into `allowed_remote_backends`. `ALLOW_ALL` removes
the allowlist check. Both allowing modes still require `allow_remote_processing=True` on each
remote backend:

```python
from pseudonymize import NetworkPolicy, Policy

policy = Policy(
    network_policy=NetworkPolicy.ALLOW_CONFIGURED,
    allowed_remote_backends={"company_provider"},
)
```

The base package provides no remote backend or HTTP dependency.
